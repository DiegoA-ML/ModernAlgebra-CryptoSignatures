# ModernAlgebra-CryptoSignatures

# Project: Using Modern Algebras for Security and Cryptography

## Descripci√≥n  

This project aims to analyze and document the use of cryptographic algorithms for digital and/or electronic signatures in a real environment. As a first step, a review of the state of the art will be carried out, considering existing solutions and standards, as well as libraries and resources available for the implementation of public key schemes.
